# ConstrucTrack Presentation

## Project Overview
ConstrucTrack is a specialized web application for construction site inventory management, developed as part of my ALX Frontend Development specialization. As a solo developer, I aimed to create a solution that bridges the gap between construction site managers and supervisors for efficient material tracking and site management.

## Architecture & Technologies

### Frontend Stack
- **React + TypeScript**: Core framework providing type-safety and robust component architecture
- **Material-UI**: Component library for professional UI elements
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management for complex application data
- **React Query**: Server state management and caching
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework

### Backend Services
- **Supabase**:
  - Authentication with role-based access
  - PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security
  - Real-time subscriptions for live updates
  - Secure file storage

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development and optimized builds
- **ESLint**: Code quality enforcement
- **Git**: Version control
- **GitHub**: Project hosting and collaboration

## Development Journey
